# Shipping groups
A shipping group is a shipping option that is available to shoppers, and is a logical grouping of carrier services that meet a certain fulfillment criteria or a delivery promise.

You can associate a maximum number of transit days to a shipping group to give guidelines about which carrier services can be included. You must configure the shipping group and 
associate at least one carrier service before the shipping group can be considered for Promising Calculations by the Calculate item delivery date and Calculate shipment assignments APIs.

## Shipping groups examples
You can display the following shipping groups on your e-commerce site:
 * STANDARD: Free shipping with delivery within 5 to 7 days
 * EXPRESS: Paid shipping with delivery with 2 to 3 days
 * PREMIUM: Paid shipping with delivery within 1 day
 * GOLD: Free shipping for customers of loyalty program within 1 day

## Managing shipping groups
You can create, edit, and delete shipping groups.
